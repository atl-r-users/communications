## Welcome!

Welcome to the Atlanta R Users Group site, where we will maintain an archive of presentations given at our monthly users group meetings. We've been on a bit of a hiatus since summer of 2021, but as students return to school for the fall 2022 semester, we will conduct Users Group meetings on a more regular basis. 

## 24 August 2022 Meeting

The August meeting included two presentations: 

* Tidycensus vs. Flat Files -- A response to Melinda Higgins, by [Leonard Greski](https://bit.ly/2Q5rmp7)
* Testing for Reproducible Research, by [Leonard Greski](https://bit.ly/2Q5rmp7) if time permits 

Towards the end of the call we discussed potential topics for subsequent meetings, and the general consensus was to continue presentations on the topic of testing. Our next meeting will be a "hands on" experience, a coding kata where we will experience test driven development in R. 

Slides, content, and a recording of the meeting are accessible below.
