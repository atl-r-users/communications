## Welcome!

Welcome to the Atlanta R Users Group site, where we will maintain an archive of presentations given at our monthly users group meetings. We've been on a bit of a hiatus since summer of 2021, but as students return to school for the fall 2022 semester, we will conduct Users Group meetings on a more regular basis. 

## 24 August 2022 Meeting

Please mark your calendar for August 24th from 7:00P - 8:30P ET for our next meeting, where we will share two presentations, including:

* Tidycensus vs. Flat Files -- A response to Melinda Higgins, by [Leonard Greski](https://bit.ly/2Q5rmp7)
* Testing for Reproducible Research, by [Leonard Greski](https://bit.ly/2Q5rmp7) if time permits 

Register at [Meetup.com](https://bit.ly/3AjT1Kx) to receive the videoconference information for the meeting.
