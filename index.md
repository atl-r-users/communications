## Welcome!

Welcome to the Atlanta R Users Group site, where we will maintain an archive of presentations given at our monthly users group meetings. 

## Next Meeting 25 February 2020

As we restart the group we will experiment with a variety of meeting formats. This month we plan to present two topics at about 20 minutes each, followed by an open discussion. Since we will meet via videoconference, we'll limit the meeting to 1 hour to minimize Zoom fatigue.

Please mark your calendar for February 25th from 7:30P - 8:30P ET for our next meeting, where we will share two presentations:

1. Web Scraping with R, and
2. Rodbc - Database connections & management using R

Details about how to connect to the Zoom videoconference will be distributed to everyone who RSVPs for the meeting.
